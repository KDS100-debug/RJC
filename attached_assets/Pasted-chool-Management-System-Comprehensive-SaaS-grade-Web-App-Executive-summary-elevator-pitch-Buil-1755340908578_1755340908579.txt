chool Management System (Comprehensive SaaS-grade Web App)

Executive summary (elevator pitch):
Build a secure, scalable, multi-tenant School Management System (SMS) that streamlines academic operations — student/teacher portals, fee collection, performance profiling, scoreboards, notifications, teacher ranking via student reviews, admin dashboards, and analytics. Deliver a responsive SPA + RESTful backend, role-based access control, and modular microservices-ready architecture suitable for deployment to cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP).

1. Objectives & Success Metrics

Primary objective: Replace manual administrative workflows with an integrated digital platform to reduce administrative overhead by ≥60% within 6 months of launch.

KPIs: time-to-grade-publish, fee-collection rate, student login adoption %, average NPS for teachers, system uptime ≥99.9%, API latency <200ms P95.

Business goals: support multi-school onboarding, recurring payments, audit trails, and exportable compliance reports (CSV, PDF).

2. Target Users & Roles

Super Admin (SaaS owner) — manage schools, tenants, billing, global configs.

School Admin / Principal — full school-level config, users, classes, fee structures, reports.

Accountant / Finance — fee management, invoices, receipts, ledgers.

Teacher — roster, grade submission, class announcements, view feedback and rankings.

Student — view profile, grades, schedule, fee status, submit feedback.

Parent — view child performance, pay fees, receive notifications.

Support / Auditor — view logs, export data, audit trails (read-only).

3. Scope (In-Scope / Out-of-Scope)

In-scope (MVP+):

User management, RBAC (roles & permissions)

Student & teacher profiles

Class & section management, timetable

Attendance (student & teacher)

Grading & scoreboards; multi-term gradebooks

Integrations: optional Power BI / Looker connectors for advanced analytics

15. Acceptance Criteria (sample)

Role-based login works for all roles and enforces permissions.

Admin can create a term, exam, assign teachers and publish grades; published grades are visible to students.

Fee invoice generation + payment via gateway completes and records payment with webhook reconciliation.

Students can submit reviews; admin can moderate and aggregate teacher rankings.

All critical flows covered by automated tests and security audit passed.

16. Deliverables (MVP)

Database schema & migration scripts

Payment integration with at least one gateway and webhook handler

CI pipeline + IaC templates for dev & prod

Test suite + Postman / OpenAPI docs

Admin manual + basic end-user documentation

Demo data and seeders for quick onboarding

17. Suggested Roadmap & Milestones (12–16 weeks)

Week 0–1: Detailed requirements, wireframes, data model sign-off

Week 2–4: Core auth, user CRUD, class/subject management, basic UI skeleton

Week 5–7: Attendance, exams, gradebook, scoreboards

Week 8–9: Fee module + payment gateway + invoices

Week 10: Notifications, teacher reviews & ranking

Week 11: Reporting, exports, auditing

Week 12: Integration testing, security hardening

Week 13: UAT & bugfixes

Week 14: Production launch & hypercare

18. Non-functional Requirements

99.9% uptime SLA (hosting dependent)

P95 API latency < 200ms under normal load

Multi-tenant isolation and horizontal scalability

Easy onboarding: <10 minutes to create a new school and seed initial classes

19. Risk & Mitigation

Payment disputes: implement idempotency & reconciliation; retain full audit trail.

Privacy breaches: encrypt PII and limit data export; implement MFA for admin accounts.

Adoption risk: provide onboarding flows, guided tours, and training docs.
