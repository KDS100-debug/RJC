Prompt Template to Recreate “Achievements” Section
Subject: Development Brief for “Achievements” Section — Ramanujan Junior College

Objective:
Produce an accurate, visually coherent “Achievements” section mirroring the structure and content of the existing page.

Content Scope:
- Prominently display each achievement category as a distinct section or card.
- Include details where available:
  - Title (e.g., “Physics Olympiad”)
  - Notable achievers (e.g., names and titles or results)
  - Context details (e.g., rank, stream, year, class, institution)

Structure & Design Requirements:
1. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Use bold headings for each category.
   - Subheadings or bullet lines for achievers and specifics.
2. **Layout**:
   - Consider a grid of cards or vertical list, responsive for mobile/desktop.
   - Ensure semantic HTML (e.g., `<h3>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`) for accessibility.
3. **Styling**:
   - Clean typography, consistent spacing, and college branding.
   - Optional icons or celebratory visuals (e.g., trophy, medal).
4. **Data Modularity**:
   - Structure content dynamically (e.g., JSON or CMS-friendly templates) to allow future updates without redesign.
